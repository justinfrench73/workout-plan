From venturebeat.com
How much does a fitness club cost? La fitness membership costs $38 per month with no initiation fee for 6 months of single club access. But for most, the high price — starting at $185 per month for access to a single location and topping out at $500 per month for the premier experience — acts as a gilded gate that keeps those outside wondering what resplendent luxuries lie inside. If you decide you want to add it on at a later time, it will be $15 per month, per child.
