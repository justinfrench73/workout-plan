<p>If you choose planet fitnessâs black card, classic or no commitment membership, you have to pay an annual fee of $39.00. You have to have been a member at one location for at least ninety days, you must have a monthly (not annual) membership, and you canât owe any outstanding dues or fees at your current club. And can refund / give 10% off at some later point for the inconvenience. No, planet fitness doesnât offer a refund if you cancel your membership early in the billing cycle. rememberlessfool No self, no freewill, permanent. https.</p>
